These are the procedure and steps that I undertook to display a review
of a restaurant that has over 5,000 reviews.

Find and download data:
I found a dataset on yelp.com where it contains a huge amount of data
containing business entities, checkins, tips, users and reviews.
Extract the tar file to a directory.

Finding a business with more than 5,000 reviews:
To find a business with more than 5,000 reviews, I wrote a python script,
"business.py" that loads and read the file "yelp_academic_dataset_business.json".
This file contains the characteristics of businesses reviewed by yelp users.
It contains the business id, name, address, reviews count and much more.
I only need to loop over the records and find the json record where the
review count > 5,000. Luckily, there was only one restaurant that has this
much reviews. I've written down the business id of this establishment.

Finding all the reviews of this Restaurant:
With the business id from the previous step, I wrote another python script,
"fetch_rest.py" where it loads and reads the file "yelp_academic_dataset_review.json".
The script loops over each line and look for business id with the data from
the previous step.

if the business id is the same, then append the review from the 'text' field.
Do this until the end of the json file. Write the data to "reviews.txt"

Sentiment and Analysis of the Reviews:
I wrote "analysis.py" to do the analysis of the reviews. I used "TextBlob"
natural language library (i.e. using NLTK) to process each line. Also, each
line is process further with sentiment polarity to view the negativity or
positiveness of the line.

Each sentiment value is stored to different python list storage. There are five
storage depending on the values:

excellent:  1.0 to 0.7
good:       0.6 to 0.3
average:    0.2 to -0.2
below avg:  -0.3 to -0.6
poor:       -0.7 to -1.0

The result is then encoded into a json data and exported to a file.

Plotting the Result:
